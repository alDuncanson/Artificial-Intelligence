### Project \#3:

#### AI Applications

Project 3 is a group project where you will choose an AI application
domain and develop a solution for a specific problem. The potential
areas encompass natural language processing, computer vision, modeling
and simulation, robotics, or others by request.

#### Problem Statement:

You will propose and implement an AI project in the previously mentioned
areas.

One possible application is to employ computer vision to reliably
recognize an object (insect, human, plant, vehicle, etc) in an image, or
track an object in a moving video. Validation of this type of project
would encompass testing against multiple images. OpenCV is a great
library for extracting information from images.

Another project might involve creating a sentiment analyzer to handle
streaming data from Twitter or similar source. The information needs to
be handled on the fly and you must produce a clustering, sentiment,
polarity, or other metric from those scores. In the same vein, it might
be interesting to write a Reddit bot that determines whether a comment
is actually informative or not. The signal to noise on news aggregation
sites can be quite high. Rather than anaylze positive/negative
sentiment, you could look at trying to decide whether there is valuable
information in the post or not.

Gaming applications are also possible. Ideas in this area would be a bot
for a popular game or AI for playing a turn-based game. I know that
there is an interface for Kerbal Space Program that allows you to use
Python to control the game through a web server. Would be interesting to
develop an AI to launch a rocket into orbit. (I may have some starter
code if this interests you.) Check with me on scope and expectations.

Microsoft has a drone simulator where you can fly a drone through a
"real-world" environment. This might be an ambitious project, but
developing a flight controller would be a fantastic application of AI.
More information about the simulator is available
[here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/aerial-informatics-robotics-platform/).
Note that this software will have a high startup cost and some unique
computing hardware requirements.

Previous projects in the course have identified open parking spaces by
analyzing video obtained from a webcam, pedestrian traffic on GVSU
sidewalks from webcam video, image recognition tasks, or various
sentiment analysis projects. Last year's highlights included the
aforementioned Kerbal Space Program bot, a Mario Kart player trained
with machine learning, and a Shakespearian composer.

#### Learning Objectives:

1.  Implement an AI Algorithm in: NLP, computer vision, modeling and
    simulation, robotics, or similar concept.
2.  Develop skills for planning a project and conducting background
    research.
3.  Gain profieciency with AI software.

#### Rubric:

##### Project Proposal:

Your project proposal should be between one and two pages and address
the following: (1) What is the project that you intend to work on? (2)
What are similar projects that have been attempted in the domain? (3)
What software/libraries will you use in this project? (4) Do you need
special hardware to complete the project, if so, do you have access to
it? (5) What are the deliverables (outcomes) to expect from your
project? (6) What is your plan to research, develop, implement, and
reflect on your project?

##### Project Deliverables:

Your writeup will be graded on the quality of the writing, and
explanation of work performed. Sometimes the work put into a project
isn't evident from the deliverables, this is your chance to explain what
your team tried and how it worked, or didn't, so that I can properly
assess your project. Some sample questions to ask: What did you try?
What parameter explorations (if relevant) did you find effective, and
any ideas why? How does your project work? What problem does it address?

Well documented code is essential to good development practices. Make
sure to document your code well, including sources for inspiration or
even where a new component was found. Clearly, and concisely explain
what the code does and how does it do it.

The project includes an in-class presentation to be given during the
last week of the semester. Presentations are to be between 8-10 minutes
long and address the questions: (1) What did you do? (2) Why did you do
it? and (3) How did you do it? Rather than focus on low-level code
details, give the broader overview of your work including descriptions
of any algorithms that you found. There may be a few minutes for
questions at the end of your presentation. I will stop you at 10 minutes
and base your grade for this portion on what you covered in the time
allotted. You are free to elect one member of your group to present, or
all members can participate. That is your decision to make as a group.

I reserve the right to award flex points for exemplary work in any areas
of this project.

Proposal is worth 50 points, separate from the project.

| Category                   | Max Score |
| -------------------------- | --------- |
| Presentation               | 30        |
| Code and Documentation     | 10        |
| Project Design/Performance | 25        |
| Writeup and Explanation    | 35        |

#### Deliverables

Submit the following through Blackboard's Assignment Manager. One
submission per group. Please include in the comments section of the
assignment the names of the group members.

1.  **(Separate Deadline)** Project Proposal Writeup
2.  Source Code for your Project
3.  A list of the packages needed to build your project.
4.  A script showing how to compile and run your project.
5.  A one-two page write up detailing the techniques you explored,
    parameters you tested, results of your explorations, and any
    difficulties that you encountered.
6.  Readme file containing the names of the group members.
