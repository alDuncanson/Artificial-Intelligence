Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Sorry, Data. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. How long can two people talk about nothing? Computer, belay that order. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. We have a saboteur aboard. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. and attack the Romulans. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Well, that's certainly good to know. Travel time to the nearest starbase? A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. They were just sucked into space. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Talk about going nowhere fast. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Computer, lights up! Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers?
